 Chrome Extension to allow users to select grades in Schoolsoft by clicking boxes rather than radio buttons

Requires [jquery-2.2.4.min.js](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js) (just include in the main folder).

While I get the extension up and running, those in non-managed environments can add it as an unpackaged extension by going to chrome://extensions, turning on developer mode, selecting "Load unpacked" and then selecting the folder.

There are probably other places in Schoolsoft where these occur. If you notice them, let me know!
